# ActsAsTree [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/amerine/acts_as_tree.png?branch=master)][travis]
[travis]: (http://travis-ci.org/amerine/acts_as_tree)


ActsAsTree extends ActiveRecord to add simple support for organizing items into parent–children relationships.

## Example

```ruby
class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ActsAsTree

  acts_as_tree order: "name"
end

root      = Category.create("name" => "root")
child1    = root.children.create("name" => "child1")
subchild1 = child1.children.create("name" => "subchild1")

root.parent   # => nil
child1.parent # => root
root.children # => [child1]
root.children.first.children.first # => subchild1
```

We also have a convenient `Presentation` module you can mixin if you want a little visual representation of the tree strucuture. Example:

```ruby
class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ActsAsTree
  extend ActsAsTree::Presentation

  acts_as_tree order: "name"
end

> Category.tree_view(:name)
root
 |_ child1
 |    |_ subchild1
 |    |_ subchild2
 |_ child2
      |_ subchild3
      |_ subchild4
=> nil
```

## Compatibility

We no longer support Ruby 1.8 or versions of Rails/ActiveRecord older than 3.0. If you're using a version of ActiveRecord older than 3.0 please use 0.1.1.

Moving forward we will do our best to support the latest versions of ActiveRecord and Ruby.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

1. Fork the project.
2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.
3. Add tests for it. This is important so we don't break it in a future version
   unintentionally.
4. Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have
   your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself so we can
   ignore when we pull)
5. Send us a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
